Getting support from Learning Equality and our community
--------------------------------------------------------

Due to the open-source nature of our work, we encourage that all inquiries, inputs, contributions and feedback are openly shared in our `Community Forums <https://community.learningequality.org/>`_, so that any user with similar questions to yours can benefit from the answer, and have a centralized place to search for it. *Please consider supporting others whenever you can. Your goals are likely overlapping with other users of Kolibri, so you may consider yourself as part of a community of like-minded practitioners!*

The first thing you need to do is register on the forum. Once registered, please read the the first two pinned topics (*Welcome to LEâ€™s Support Community* and *How do I post to this forum?* ) 

You can add a new topic with the :guilabel:`+ New Topic` button on the right. Make sure to select the appropriate category in the **Create a New Topic** window to facilitate the triage and response processes.
