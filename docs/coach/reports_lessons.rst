#. Click on the lesson title to view its list of resources.
#. In the selected lesson **Report** sub-tab, you can see the clickable list of resources, with their own *progress* and the *average time spent* on.
#. When you click to open the single resource, you can see the progress report for each learner (*started* |started|, *completed* |completed-small| or *need help* |need-help|), and the time spent on it.
#. If the resource is an exercise, you can access the **Difficult questions** sub-tab and review each attempt with incorrect answers.
#. Open the **Learners** sub-tab to access the progress report per each learner. 
#. Click the :guilabel:`OPTIONS` button and select **Edit details** or **Manage resources** option if you want to edit the lesson directly from its report. Editing the lesson details from here will have the same results as from the **Plan** tab (|edit| icon).

   .. note:: 
      The columns *Progress* and *Recipients* in the **Reports > Lessons** sub-tab display a summary, but when you export the report as a CSV file and open it in a spreadsheet application, you will see separate columns for each progress status, compared to the summary representation in Kolibri. *Recipients (1)* column indicates if the lesson was assigned to the entire class or to group(s), in which case they will be listed in the *Recipients (2)* column.
