Manage Groups
-------------

In case you need to further divide learners inside classes, for example to address the different progress needs, you can use the **Groups** feature. Create and delete groups, as well as assign learners to them from the **Groups** sub-tab in the **Plan** tab (|edit| icon) of your **Coach** dashboard. Default view displays the list of all groups for the selected class, with the number of assigned learners for each group.
